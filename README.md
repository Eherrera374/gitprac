# Analysis project to determine which factors may or may not influence driver's susceptibility to accepting coupons

The provided coupons.csv file was the source of all data used in this project

After data exploration and description some light cleaning/filling was done to the dataset.

## The first barplot shows us the coffee coupons were the most numerous of all types.

## Next a histogram shows us the temperature distrubition of all occurrances within the dataset

### Coupon acceptance rates are then compared between drivers of differing circumstances (this can be seen throughout the notebook)

## Lastly we have a couple more bar plots which show Carrout / Take away coupon and mid range restaurant coupon acceptance rate by certain passenger types.
